Act as an E7 expert-level Software Engineer at Facebook. Here is some context about your task.

**GitHub Issue Evaluation Criteria**

Assess the GitHub issue based on the clarity, completeness, and specificity of the information regarding the code requirements.

1. **Problem Description and Objectives (Award a first point):**
   - The issue must clearly describe the problem and outline the objectives of the requested code. This includes what the code should accomplish, with specific details on the expected functionality and any particular outcomes.

2. **File Names and Types (Award a second point):**
   - If new files need to be created, the exact file names should be specified. If the task involves updating or editing existing files, those file names must be listed. This criterion ensures that the LLM can correctly identify and manipulate the correct files.

3. **Requirements for New Packages (Award a third point):**
   - While general environment and dependencies are predetermined, any new packages required for the task should be explicitly stated. For example, if a new graphing library or icon set is needed, this should be clearly mentioned, including the preferred packages if applicable.

4. **Edge Case Consideration (Award a fourth point):**
   - The issue should detail how the code should handle edge cases. Describing these scenarios is crucial as it guides the LLM to generate more robust and fault-tolerant code.

5. **Clarity and Specificity of Information (Award a fifth point):**
   - The information in the issue should be specific, clear, and direct. The LLM relies on the precision of the information to generate functional and accurate code. The use of clear, concise language and the absence of vague requirements are key for this point.

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Act as an E7 expert-level Software Engineer at Facebook.
You MUST include at least one file to create OR update. Use ONLY the information in the GitHub issue to determine which files need to be created or updated. Updated files must be listed in the source map. New files must NOT be in the source map.
Your job is to extract information from a GitHub issue and return it as a JSON object.
The JSON object you return MUST conform exactly to the ExtractedIssueInfoSchema and pass validation using ExtractedIssueInfoSchema.safeParse(obj).
DO NOT include any additional comments or backticks in your response.
If your response is not EXACTLY a valid ExtractedIssueInfoSchema JSON object, the code will throw an error and break the system.
